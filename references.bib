  abstract = {This review has two primary objectives: (1) to offer a balanced examination of recent findings on the relationship between screen media activity (SMA) in young individuals and outcomes such as sleep patterns, mood disturbances, anxiety-related concerns, and cognitive processes; and (2) to introduce a novel multi-level system model that integrates these findings, resolves contradictions in the literature, and guides future studies in examining key covariates affecting the SMA-mental health relationship. Key findings include: (1) Several meta-analyses reveal a significant association between SMA and mental health issues, particularly anxiety and depression, including specific negative effects linked to prolonged screen time; (2) substantial evidence indicates that SMA has both immediate and long-term impacts on sleep duration and quality; (3) the relationship between SMA and cognitive functioning is complex, with mixed findings showing both positive and negative associations; and (4) the multifaceted relationship between SMA and various aspects of adolescent life is influenced by a wide range of environmental and contextual factors. SMA in youth is best understood within a complex system encompassing individual, caregiver, school, peer, and environmental factors, as framed by Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, which identifies five interrelated systems (microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem) that influence development across both proximal and distal levels of the environment. This model provides a framework for future research to examine these interactions, considering moderating factors, and to develop targeted interventions that can mitigate potential adverse effects of SMA on mental well-being.}
