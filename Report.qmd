## Recommendation

Based on the analysis results, we propose some solutions as follows:

- First, education organisations should organize workshops to raise students' awareness of the negative impacts of social media abuse. 

- Secondly, since they are spending too much time on social media, we suggest having digital marketing campaigns targeted to them, which help them become aware of these risky outcomes. For example: Run a campaign focused on the 30-day reducing time screen challenge.

- Thirdly, both schools and parents need to coordinate to support students in developing time management and emotional regulation skills.

- Finally, due to limitations in time and research resources, this analysis only focuses on the three most fundamental aspects of self-control ability and does not delve into the causes of social media addiction. Moreover, the number of study subjects in the low-addiction group was small, which may have led to bias in the analysis. To better support future research, we suggest collecting data across level groups evenly and expanding the scope of analysis to include psychological factors as well as the content that students typically engage with on social media. Clarifying the addictive factors will help draw deeper conclusions and develop more comprehensive intervention strategies or recommendations.
