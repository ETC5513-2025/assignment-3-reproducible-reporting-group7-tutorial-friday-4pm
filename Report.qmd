## Conclusion

Normally, the time spent on social media cannot completely prove whether a person is addicted to social media or not, it depends on the purpose of using social media of that person. Besides, the level of conflict with relatives and learning results can also be affected by other external factors such as psychological factors, health, etc. However, these different factors are common traits of students addicted to social media. This was demonstrated through this analysis. The results of the analysis showed a clear relationship between the level of social media addiction and the decline in self-control in students. Students with high levels of social media addiction not only spent more time on social media, but also tended to have more interpersonal conflicts and were negatively affected in their academic performance. These findings suggest that excessive social media use can reduce students’ ability to control their time, emotions, and learning – three key aspects of personal and academic development.
